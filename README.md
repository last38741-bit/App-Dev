#Miyamoto Musashi – The Way of the Sword

> “The way of the sword is the way of life — every strike defines who you are.”  
> “Strength is not found in victory, but in the courage to fight your own weakness.”  
> “A true warrior doesn’t seek battles — he becomes one with them.”  
> “Musashi taught me that mastery is not a destination, but a lifelong duel with oneself.”  
> “Discipline sharpens the blade; purpose gives it meaning.”  
> “Even in silence, a samurai’s spirit speaks louder than words.”  
> “The sword is merely a tool — the mind that wields it decides the outcome.”  
> “Like Musashi, I fight not to win, but to understand who I am.”  
> “Victory is reserved for those who can see beyond fear.”  
> “Two swords, one soul — balance is the true strength of Musashi.”
